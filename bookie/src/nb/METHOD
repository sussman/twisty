Description of the translation system
=====================================

$Id: METHOD 1938 2006-01-20 01:39:01Z sunny256 $

This is a description of the translation method used in the Norwegian 
svnbook since it started way too long ago. The system is designed to try 
to make translation and keeping the files in sync with the English files 
as easy as possible. If you are new to the translation, browse through 
this file, hopefully you won’t find the system too painful to follow.

The translated files are copies of the English files, which all the 
translations are based upon. To ensure proper updating and make 
syntactically checks against the English files possible, nothing is 
removed from the English sections in the files, only added. The English 
text is kept in the files, but are commented out with special markers:

    <!-- @ENGLISH {{{
    <para>This edition of the book has been updated to cover new
      features and behavioral changes in Subversion 1.1.  Here's a
      brief list of pointers to major 1.1 changes.</para>
    @ENGLISH }}} -->
    <para>Denne utgaven av boken er blitt oppdatert for å dekke nye 
      funksjoner og forandringer i oppførselen for Subversion 1.1.
      Her er en rask oversikt over pekere til store forandringer i 
      1.1.</para>

It may look as a tedious task to add those markers, but this is taken 
care of by a macro defined in src/nb/tools/svnbook.vim . If you also set 
"foldmethod=marker" in Vim, the translated English text is automatically 
folded away. (The only editor that has been used for the translation is 
Vim, so the description here evolves around that one.)

Editmode and commitmode
=======================

Because the English text is still present, but merely commented out, it 
leads to problems when double dashes ("--") are used there. Double 
dashes inside XML comments are forbidden, so they have to be escaped in 
some way to not cripple the XML. This is done by the 
src/nb/bin/clean_files script which can switch the files between two 
modes: “commit mode” and “edit mode”. The difference between those two 
modes is:

  * Commit mode
    An unique character from the “private use” area in the Unicode table 
    (&#64738;, U+FCE2) is inserted between all occurences of double 
    dashes in everything that is commented out, i.e. the English text. 
    This makes the XML valid and can be checked into the repository or 
    be built.
  * Edit mode
    All the &#64738;s are removed, and the files are now ready for 
    diffing against the English files or something else. You probably 
    won’t need to run this command unless you have to resolve conflicts 
    or check that nothing have changed in the English sections. It can 
    also be practical to use if you have to copy+paste examples or text 
    with lots of double dashes. Just exit your editor, run "make 
    editmode" and continue editing. This mode is only for editing 
    purposes, and the files must not be checked in while in this mode. 
    Run a “make commitmode” to get all files in shape first.

Normally you don’t have to think about running these make commands, 
except when you’ve translated text that contains double hyphens. If 
there are some double dashes which needs escaping, the make process (you 
always make before checkin, right?) will return errors like

  book/ch03.xml:327: parser error : Comment must not contain '--' 
  (double-hyphen)

and you will need to run “make commitmode” to heal the files.

The actual translation
======================

To translate a paragraph, the English text has to be commented out and 
the translation follows immediately after the commented-out block. This 
is done with the predefined macro in src/nb/tools/svnbook.vim which 
filters the block through the src/nb/bin/dings_it script. Yeh, oddball 
name, but it works.

Mark the paragraph with Shift-V in Vim and press <F5>. The macro expects 
the dings_it script to exist at ~/bin/dings_it, and if it does, the 
block is automatically commented out and all the elements with the 
attributes intact are copied after the block, and the cursor is placed 
in the right position ready for writing. Repeat this process through the 
file.

Some conventions exists, much to the lack of protests, and to keep 
things consistent, over to some formatting rules:

  * Width of text lines is 72 characters.
  * As usual, use no TABs, only spaces.
  * When marking and commenting out English paragraphs, don’t break the 
    element structure, for example by including a </listitem> without 
    also including the start tag. In essence, try to only include the 
    actual text when commenting out the original text, not block-level 
    elements.
  * To make reformatting cleaner and to avoid cluttering the diffs with 
    large sections of wordwrapping, the whole translation uses “flowed 
    text” (wrapped lines are terminated by a space) and every sentence 
    is written on a new line. This limits wordwrapping to the current 
    sentence only and doesn’t mess up the whole paragraph.

Fuzzy translations
==================

At some point or another, you will come across sentences or words that 
can be hard to translate. Instead of fiddling around with the sentence 
for many minutes, mark it with a commented-out ¤ (U+00A4, currency sign) 
just before the dubious word, sentence or translation. As long as it is 
properly marked, it can be searched up and fixed later.

The TRANSLATION-STATUS file
===========================

The Subversion book isn’t exactly small, so to keep things tidy and 
manageable, the current status of the translation should always be 
logged in the TRANSLATION-STATUS file. If more translators are working 
on the same translation, it’s probably best to let each translator work 
on different files to avoid conflicts. When a translator grabs a new 
file, the first thing to do is to move the name of the file from the 
“Untranslated” section into the “In progress” section where it is marked 
with the user name of the translator who wants that file. When this 
commit succeeds, the file is officially that translator’s domain, and if 
the translator of some reason or another doesn’t want to work more on 
that file, the name is removed so another translator can continue on it. 
When the file is finished, it is moved to the “Finished” section.

Proofreading of the files is also logged in this file, in the 
“Proofread” section. When you start proofreading a file, add the name of 
the file in this section along with the user name and the line number of 
the current proofread position. Example:

  book/ch04.xml (USERNAME, line 2453)

Keeping the translation updated
===============================

With the rapid development of Subversion, not keeping the translation in 
sync with the English version soon makes the information old and 
incomplete. To make the process of synchronising the translated version 
with the English version as safe and easy as possible, Subversion itself 
is merging new changes from the src/en/ directory structure into the 
src/nb/ area. This is taken care of by "make sync". This make process 
does the following things:

  1. sets all the files into edit mode (removes the &#64738;s) to 
     minimise the chance of conflicts,
  2. merges the changes since the last synchronisation into the 
     translation from the English version, and
  3. sets all files back to commit mode.

You can then copy the exact changes into the translated sections. Using 
a visual diff tool in these circumstances is a great help.

To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it is very important that the English 
text remain unchanged. Don’t remove or add whitespace, for example. New 
content is _added_ to the file, it is not _replacing_ something. Use 
those @ENGLISH markers. If this is done properly, syncronising against 
the English version is quite easy and seldom produces conflicts. An 
example of a sync session goes as follows:

  cd src/nb/
  make sync
  # New updates from the book are now merged into the working copy. By 
  # using tools like svndiff 
  # <http://svn.sunbase.org/repos/svnutils/trunk/src/svndiff> or vimdiff 
  # (part of the Vim package) it is fairly easy to copy the changes from 
  # the English sections to the translated sections.
  #
  # Ensure that all files are ready for commit:
  make commitmode
  # Then, check that nothing in the English parts have changed, i.e. the 
  # XML file corresponds to the English copy:
  make bookdiff
  # Check that the XML doesn’t contain errors:
  make valid
  # If xmllint(1) is not available, make a test build:
  make book-html
  # Commit:
  svn checkin

That’s mostly it. Doing this on a regular basis or when big things 
happen in the English section eases the sync pain.

But if the last sync was done a long time ago or there have been 
horrible revolutions in the src/en/ directory so things gets really 
messy after the merge, you have the option to do the merge in smaller 
steps. Let’s say that a file rename happens in r1000 and there are lots 
of file changes before and after this rename. What you can do, is to 
first merge in all the changes from when the last synchronisation was 
done (stored in the LAST_UPDATED file) up to r999, and then take the 
following merges in decent steps:

  make sync HEAD=999

This will only merge the changes up to r999, hopefully making life 
easier. The step involving “make sync” can be repeated several times 
even if the files in the working copy are modified.

Some make commands
==================

Almost every action on the files can be done from various make commands. 
In addition to the makes available in the English version these can also 
be used:

* make sync
    Merge all new changes from the English XML files to the translated 
    version.
* make bookdiff
    Check that the English parts of the translated files are identical 
    to the original English data. Creates two files — bd.tmp/eng.txt and 
    bd.tmp/norw.txt — which can be studied if there are inconsistency 
    between the versions.
* make engdir
    Create a book/eng/ directory which is nice to have around if it’s 
    necessary to diff against the master files.
* make commitmode
    Prepare the files for commit.
* make editmode
    Remove the &#64738; entities to make it easier to compare the files 
    against the original version, for example the files in 
    src/nb/book/eng/ which is created by make engdir.

Scripts
=======

* src/nb/bin/clean_files
    Converts between editmode and commitmode.
* src/nb/bin/dings_it
    Used during the translation. Takes care of commenting out the 
    English text and copies all the XML elements. Called from the <F5> 
    macro in svnbook.vim and is expected to exist as ~/bin/dings_it .
* src/nb/bin/h2u
* src/nb/bin/u2h
    Two scripts which is not used anymore, converts to/from numerical 
    entities to/from UTF-8.
* src/nb/bin/strip_english
    Removes the @ENGLISH markers with the English text from the XML 
    files, useful if the XML source is going to be distributed and 
    duplication of the English text is not a good thing.
