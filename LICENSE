                      Twisty Licensing & Distribution
                      ===============================

This is free software distributed as a whole under the GNU General
Public License version 3.  See the COPYING file for the full license.

 * The GLK-JNI layer (which is a compilation and link-time dependency
   for this software) is also under GPL v3.

 * The Nitfol z-machine interpreter (version 0.5) was originally
   distributed under a GPL v2 license "or later versions", and thus
   we're distributing it here under version 3, slightly modified to
   link into our glkjni GLK implementation.

 * The Git glulx interpreter (version 1.2.4) is normally distributed
   under the MIT license.  Because the MIT license is compatible with
   the GPL, this doesn't affect the overal GPLv3 license for Twisty.
   Again, the version herein is slightly tweaked to work with glkjni.

 * The bundled games are under their own separate free licenses,
   listed below.  Note that they're not affected by the GPL, since
   they are neither compile nor run-time dependencies; Twisty merely
   'interprets' them as playable games and they're distributed within
   the package only for users' convenience.

              Licenses on Bundled Games


* 'Adventure' is a re-creation of the very first text adventure game
  ever.  It was originally written by William Crowther and Donald
  Woods for a mainframe, but later recreated from scratch (by Graham
  Nelson) to run on the z-machine.

  The source and binary are freely distributed around the internet,
  with no license or distribution terms attached.  The Inform 6 source
  code can be fetched from

    http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/source/inform/Advent.inf


* 'Anchorhead' is a Lovecraftian-style horror game by Michael
  S. Gentry, and a finalist and winner in the 1998 Xyzzy Awards.
  According to the 'help' message within the game, the game is
  "absolutely freeware".


* 'Curses' is a game by Graham Nelson <graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk>,
   and is freely distributable by anyone, provided there's no profit involved.

   The official blurb from Graham is:

      "Curses" is not shareware, it's free: I wrote it for fun.  It
       may be freely distributed provided you aren't making a profit
       on the deal; I have allowed several magazines to put it on
       cover discs, so feel free to get in touch if you have that in
       mind.  But it _is_ copyright, and the source code is _not_
       public.  Moreover, the secret debugging commands may only be
       divulged to a druid of good standing.
